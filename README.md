# GP_Sonic_Prediction_Dataset
Dataset for IEEE Journal Paper "Multi-stage Genetic Programming for Sonic Log Prediction"

This repository contains datasets used for P-wave (DT) and S-wave (DTS) sonic log prediction research using Multi-Stage Genetic Programming. The data was taken from the Volve Field dataset from Equinor. More details about this data [here](https://www.equinor.com/energy/volve-data-sharing)

The dataset is in Excel format. There are 3 files:

* Original dataset with various geophysical logs from 3 wells (Well 11/9-F-1A, 11/9-F-1B, 11/9-F-11A)
* Dataset with normalized logs for DT prediction. 3 sheets; Full set, training set, testing set
* Dataset with normalized logs for DTS prediction. 3 sheets; Full set, training set, testing set
